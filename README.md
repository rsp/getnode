Getnode downloads, configures, builds and tests Node.js
Project home page: [https://github.com/rsp/getnode]

Usage: 
       getnode VERSION
       getnode VERSION PREFIX

Downloads: http://nodejs.org/dist/node-vVERSION.tar.gz
and builds for installation in PREFIX or /opt/node by default.
If PREFIX is 'v' or 'V' it is equivalent to /opt/node-VERSION

Examples:
          getnode 0.2.6
          getnode 0.2.6 v
          getnode 0.2.6 /usr/local

ABOUT NODE
----------

Node.js is an event-driven I/O framework for the V8 JavaScript engine
developed by Ryan Dahl.  For more info see: [http://nodejs.org/]

ABOUT GETNODE
-------------

Getnode is a shell script written by Rafa≈Ç Pocztarski to speed up Node
deployments.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Getnode uses Wget to download the source code of Node, Tar to extract it and
Make to build it.  Building Node requires essential development tools like
Make and a C++ compiler, Python version 2.4 or higher and a development
version of the SSL library.  Testing Node requires cURL.

Most of those tools are probably installed by default on any modern system.
For example on a fresh install of Ubuntu Server 10.10 you need to run:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev curl

to have everything needed to build Node.

For more info on Node's dependencies see:
https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Installation

TODO
----

There is still a lot to do to make this script more useful.

The default installation prefix will change and more shortcuts will be added.

There should be an option to build without SSL and maybe without testing.

This is an early version, use it at your own risk.
